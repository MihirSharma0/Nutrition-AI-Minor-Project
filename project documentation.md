## 4. User Roles

| Role | Description |
|---|---|
| **User** | General consumer. Builds profile, gets nutrition targets, analyzes food, tracks intake, gets meal plans/recommendations, can consult nutritionists. |
| **Nutritionist** | Professional. Registers → Admin verifies → can view consenting users' data and issue professional plans. |
| **Admin** | Internal staff. Manages users/nutritionists, food/additive/allergen databases, AI rules, and system analytics. Not self-registrable. |

---

## 5. Functional Requirements by Module

### Module 1 — Authentication & Account Management
- Users register with name, email, password.
- If OTP is enabled (Admin toggle), send a one-time code from a company email; account activates only after correct OTP entry.
- Admin can enable/disable OTP verification globally at runtime (no redeploy).
- Login returns a JWT; logout invalidates the session.
- "Forgot Password" sends a secure, time-limited reset link/OTP.
- Authenticated users can change password (must re-enter current password).
- Nutritionist registration requires professional details (credentials, specialization) and stays "Pending Verification" until Admin approval.
- Nutritionist can edit their public profile once verified.
- RBAC enforced at API layer for User/Nutritionist/Admin.
- Admin accounts are provisioned internally, not via public registration.

**Business rules:** Passwords hashed with bcrypt/Argon2, never logged in plaintext. OTPs expire (default 10 min), single-use. Nutritionist-only features blocked until verification = Approved.

### Module 2 — User Profile & Personalization
- Personal info: name, age, gender, height, weight.
- Activity level: Sedentary / Lightly Active / Moderately Active / Very Active / Highly Active-Athlete.
- Goal: General Nutrition / Weight Loss / Weight Maintenance / Muscle Gain / Strength-Performance.
- Diet type: Vegetarian / Non-Vegetarian / Vegan / Other.
- Allergies: predefined list (Milk, Nuts, Gluten, Soy, Egg) + free-text custom allergies.
- Food preferences: favorites, dislikes, taste, cuisine.
- Food Budget Profile: Lifestyle Class (Middle-Class / High-Income Class) + Preferred Meal Budget (Budget/Affordable or High/Premium).
- Any profile update triggers immediate recalculation of nutrition targets.
- Input validation on physiological ranges (age, height, weight).

### Module 3 — Personalized Nutrition Requirement Engine
- Calculate Daily Calorie Target (BMR/TDEE methodology using age, gender, height, weight, activity level).
- Calculate Protein/Carb/Fat targets (grams) from calorie target + goal.
- Calculate Daily Fiber Target and Daily Water Target (from body weight + activity).
- Estimate micronutrient targets: Iron, Calcium, Vitamin D, Vitamin B12, Vitamin C, Magnesium, Potassium, Zinc.
- Apply goal-based adjustments (Weight Loss / Maintenance / Muscle Gain / Strength-Performance / General Nutrition).
- Auto-recalculate on relevant profile changes.
- Admin can tune calculation coefficients via AI/Recommendation Rules without code changes.

### Module 4 — AI Food Analyzer
**Input:** food image (camera/upload), barcode scan, ingredient-label image, nutrition-label image.

**Processing:**
- Food/product recognition via AI vision model.
- OCR extracts ingredients, nutrition values, product info, serving size.
- Ingredient detection/classification + diet-type suitability check.
- Additive analysis: preservatives, artificial colors, sweeteners, flavor enhancers, other.
- Allergen detection compared against user's recorded allergies → explicit warning on match.
- Nutrition analysis: calories, protein, carbs, fat, fiber, sugar, sodium, micronutrients.

**Verdict:**
- 🟢 **Safe** — suitable, no relevant allergen, fits diet, fits requirements.
- 🟡 **Caution** — high sugar/sodium/fat, additive concern, or personal-preference concern.
- 🔴 **Avoid** — relevant allergen detected, diet conflict, personal restriction, or major concern.
- Always include a plain-language Verdict Explanation (why safe/caution/avoid).
- On Caution/Avoid, suggest at least one Better Alternative from the Food Database.

### Module 5 — Food & Nutrition Tracker
- Log meals under Breakfast / Lunch / Snacks / Dinner.
- Logging methods: text search, barcode scan, image upload, manual entry.
- Water intake logged incrementally.
- Display Target / Consumed / Remaining for calories, protein, carbs, fat, fiber, water — updated immediately per log.
- Edit/delete past entries with automatic recalculation.
- Retain historical logs (timestamped) for Analytics.

### Module 6 — Protein Tracker
- Daily Protein Target / Consumed / Remaining + progress indicator.
- Categorize sources: Dairy (Milk, Curd, Paneer, Greek Yogurt), Plant-Based (Soy, Tofu, Lentils, Chickpeas, Beans), Non-Vegetarian (Eggs, Chicken, Fish, Meat).
- Filter suggestions by diet type (exclude non-veg sources for vegetarians, etc.).
- Updates in real time as food is logged (Module 5).

### Module 7 — AI Meal Planner
- Plans differentiated by Lifestyle Class (Middle-Class / High-Income Class), each with Budget and High-Budget variants.
- Daily Meal Plan: Breakfast, Mid-Morning, Lunch, Evening Snack, Dinner.
- Weekly Meal Plan: Monday–Sunday, built from daily plans.
- Aligned to goal (Weight Loss / Maintenance / Muscle Gain / Performance).
- Matches calorie/protein/carb/fat/fiber/micronutrient targets within tolerance.
- Budget tier drives ingredient/meal selection (low-cost vs. premium).
- Auto-generate Smart Grocery List: ingredients, quantity, estimated cost, budget status (within/over budget).
- Allow swapping/regenerating individual meals while preserving nutrition/budget targets.
- Allow marking plan items complete → feeds Analytics adherence tracking.

### Module 8 — "What Should I Eat?"
- Inputs: Hunger Level, Mood/Feeling, Craving, optional Available Ingredients, Diet Preference, Allergies, Budget.
- Computes Remaining Nutrition at request time (calories, protein, carbs, fat, fiber, water).
- Returns ONE Personalized Recommendation: food/meal, portion suggestion, nutrition contribution, estimated cost, reason for recommendation.
- Allow requesting an alternative if the first isn't acceptable.

### Module 9 — Nutrition Gap Detection
- Continuously compares Target vs. Actual Intake across calories, protein, carbs, fat, fiber, water, micronutrients.
- Identifies gaps per dimension.
- Classifies gaps as Important / Moderate / Minor (based on % unmet + time remaining in day).
- Matches gaps against Food Database (Food Matching) and composite meals (Meal Matching), respecting Budget.
- Updates immediately after any new food log.

### Module 10 — AI Food Assistant
- Conversational chat for free-text nutrition questions.
- Suggests recipes and meal ideas.
- Explains nutrition concepts and reasoning behind targets/verdicts.
- Suggests alternatives respecting diet, allergies, budget.
- Personalizes responses using user profile, targets, and remaining nutrition.

### Module 11 — Nutritionist Module

- View nutritionist profile: credentials, specialization, aggregate rating.
- Submit ratings/reviews after consultation.
- Submit a Consultation Request to a chosen nutritionist.
- On acceptance, exchange contact details for further communication (no in-app messaging/payment in v1).
- Nutritionist can only view a user's Nutrition Targets, Food Logs, Progress after explicit, revocable consent (DataSharingConsent).
- Verified nutritionist can issue a Professional Plan (meal plan, diet plan, recommendations) to a consenting client.

### Module 12 — Analytics & Progress

## 8. Non-Functional Requirements

| Category | Requirement |
|---|---|
| **Performance** | 95% of CRUD API calls < 500ms. AI operations respond/progress within 3s, complete within 15s. Support 1,000+ concurrent users. |
| **Security** | Bcrypt/Argon2 password hashing. HTTPS only. JWT with refresh rotation. Server-side RBAC on every endpoint. Consent-gated nutritionist data access. Secrets via env vars only. |
| **Usability** | Verdicts never rely on color alone (text + icon). Core flows completable in ≤3 taps from Dashboard. WCAG 2.1 AA for primary flows. |
| **Reliability** | 99.5% monthly uptime target. AI/OCR outages degrade gracefully (manual logging unaffected). Scheduled DB backups (≤24h data-loss window). |
| **Scalability** | Independently deployable/scalable containers (client/server/db). Schema changes via Flyway migrations. AI rules externally configurable. |
| **Portability** | Identical behavior across local Docker Compose, staging, and production via env-var config only. |
